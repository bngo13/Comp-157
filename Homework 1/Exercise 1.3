 // Done in other computer REMEMBER TO CHECK !todo()
b.
    Using array: 32 12 45 12(2)

    Count[0] = 0 2 0 0 | 2
    Count[1] = 0 0 1 0 | 1
    Count[2] = 0 1 1 1 | 3
    Count[3] = 0 0 0 0 | 0

    S[0] = 12(2)
    S[1] = 12
    S[2] = 32
    S[3] = 45

    No, this algorithm is not stable. The values 12(2) and 12 got switched post algorithm
c.
    This algorithm is not in place. The array Count is created, which would take up more space than entered.
