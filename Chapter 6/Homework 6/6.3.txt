        1. start at the root node
        2. go to the left node if there is a node there
        3. repeat step 2
        4. smallest = the current node
        5. go back to the root node
        6. go to the right node if there is a node there
        7. repeat step 6
        8. largest = the current node
        9. return valueOf(largest) - valueOf(smallest)
    b
        True, since everytime the avl tree has to pivot, the largest and smallest number will get rearranged to either the lowest or second lowest value
