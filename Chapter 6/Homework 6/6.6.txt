    To solve this we have to solve for the x and y separately.

    For x:
        Add up all the points for each x coordinate
        Divide the result by the amount of x coordinates there are

    For y:
        Add up all the points for each y coordinate
        Divide the result by the amount of y coordinates there are

    The solution is the resulting (x, y)

    This problem can also be solved efficiently by using problem reduction. When reducing the problem, we effectively find a smaller version of the problem to solve, which in this case is minimizing the equation provided to find correct point. When minimizing down to a line, we can use the algorithm above and find that the midpoint would be the best solution. We can then use this knowledge to scale up, finding the midpoint of all the points all the way up to n. When doing this, we will get the general method above.
